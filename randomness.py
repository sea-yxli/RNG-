# answers:
# 1. the new range is from 1 to 5
# the random numbers are now consistent each time you run the code. Therefore, the random.seed() function is used to generate the same random numbers
# a new sequence of numbers are given, and they also stay consistent each time you run the code with the same integer inside the function random.seed()
# it is used in Minecraft to ensure that when the player inserts a certain seed, the new world created always looks the same. It allows the player to generate a seemingly random world; while the number of seeds are finite, there are quintillions of possible combinations of integers and alphabetical letters, and thus quintillions of possible seeds. By entering the same seed, a player can generate their world again, before it was modified by them.
